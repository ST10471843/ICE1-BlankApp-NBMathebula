### Project Experience Overview:

Creating the application was a smooth process because I made use of my LU1 notes on Arc and it had very clear instructions on how to use the terminal to set things up, this made
it easy to grasp the concept of start a creating an application on Visual Studio. I experimented a bit by changing the background app color.

### Steps:
I first began by opening my file explorer and creating an ice task folder under the subjects folder. I then proceeded to open the folder within my Visual Studio App. 
I started up a new terminal and used the "npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript" command. I was prompted to give an app name and once that was done I edited the 
default App.tsx files text. Lastly I ran the app using the "npx expo start" command, pressed "a", ran on bluestacks and captured a screenshot.

### Challenges:
When setting up to create the app, I made the mistake of writing the wrong file name which caused me to recieve an error message witten that the file in the packge.json file could not be found.
I checked my file title under that package and corrected it in the file explorer just by renaming the folder correctly.
